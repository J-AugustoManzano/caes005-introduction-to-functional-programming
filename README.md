# CAES005 - Introduction to Functional Programming

This is a course offered by the Graduate Program in Applied Computing (PPGCA) of the 
Federal University of Technology - Parana (UTFPR), originally intended for graduate students. 
The course has been taught in English to Brazilian and foreign students since 2016. 

## Professor 

Adolfo Neto is an Associate Professor at UTFPR. He is a member of the [Education, Training, & Adoption Working Group of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/wg/education). He is also co-creator and co-host of the [Elixir em Foco podcast](https://elixiremfoco.com/), a podcast about Elixir and the BEAM for the Portuguese-speaking community.

## Learning Objectives

*In construction*

At the end of this course, you will be able to:
- solve problems using a functional programming language of your choice
- describe and discuss the main functional programming concepts 
- apply the main functional programming concepts in your programs


## Prerequisites

The course is intended for Masters and PhD students but undergraduate foreign students and local undergrads with an interest in the topic are more than welcome. 
There is no formal prerequisite in addition to a good understanding of English, as the discussed literature and interaction in class will be in that language.

## Syllabus


Functional Programming: concepts and main Languages. Functions: functions as first class citizens, named functions and anonymous functions, currying, modules. Pattern Matching. Data structures and immutability. Recursion. Collection processing. Lazy evaluation. Control flow. Project implementation involving a functional language. Overview of functional languages for concurrency.


## Schedule

Important Dates: The course will start July 2 and will finish August 27. Classes will be online, on Friday
mornings, from 8:20 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.

*In construction*

- Functional Programming: Concepts and Main Languages (LISP, Scheme, Clojure, Haskell, F# , Elixir, Erlang)
- Functions: functions as first-class citizens, named and anonymous functions, currying, modules
- Pattern Matching 
- Data structures and Immutability
- Recursion
- Collection processing 
- Lazy evaluation. 
- Control flow 
- Implementing projects using a functional programming language  
- General view of concurrent functional programming languages  (Erlang and Elixir)


## Learning methodology and assessment

"students will be invited to read papers, essays and books whose
content has to be prepared for debate in class so that they can develop an understanding of what
motivates and how can human efforts and knowledge be harnessed for specific intended objectives.
Students will produce digests/abstracts of the texts that will be uploaded previous to classes in which the
texts will be discussed. At the end of the course, students will be submitted to a final exam by means of
which we will attempt to assess how well they are able to understand and reason about the different
issues that were discussed."

## Technological Support

We will use Discord for discussion and Zoom or Google Meet sessions for our synchronous meetings.
