# CAES005 - Introduction to Functional Programming

This is a course offered by the Graduate Program in Applied Computing (PPGCA) of the 
Federal University of Technology - Parana (UTFPR), originally intended for graduate students. 
The course has been taught in English to Brazilian and foreign students since 2016.
